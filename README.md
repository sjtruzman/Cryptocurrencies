# Cryptocurrencies

## Crypto Market Analysis

### Overview

#### The aim of this project is to create a report for an investment bank that wants to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio. We will assist Martha in building this analysis so the company can offer a new cryptocurrency portfolio to their customers. The report understands what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be aggregated to create a classification system for that new investment. For this project, I perform unsupervised machine learning functions on the data provided by CryptoCompare.
